Traffic Light System made by Python and Tkinter

This project implements a simple traffic signal system with two signals A and B.
When the number of cars passing through one signal exceeds limit, that signal turns red and the other signal turns green.
The GUI allows the user to input the number of cars passing through each signal and displays the current status of the signals
